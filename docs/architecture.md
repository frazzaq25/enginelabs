# Architecture Overview

The EHR Provider Notes platform is being developed as a modular system with clearly distinguished responsibilities:

- **Backend (`backend/`):** Hosts the API surface, domain logic, and integrations required to support provider note taking. It is authored in TypeScript targeting Node.js and will eventually expose HTTP and event-driven interfaces.
- **Frontend (`frontend/`):** Delivers the provider-facing web application. The workspace is prepared for a React + TypeScript stack and will consume backend APIs alongside authentication and analytics services.
- **Shared Tooling:** Linting, formatting, TypeScript configuration, and git hooks live at the repository root to guarantee a consistent developer experience across workspaces.

This document will grow as the implementation maturesâ€”future sections should capture decisions around data storage, deployment topologies, service boundaries, and integration points with upstream EHR vendors.
